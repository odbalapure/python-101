# If weâ€™re only trying to calculate the perimeter of one polygon in the context 
# of a much greater problem, using a function will probably be the quickest to 
# code and easier to use one time only. On the other hand, if our program needs 
# to manipulate numerous polygons in a wide variety of ways (calculating the perimeter, 
# area, and intersection with other polygons, moving or scaling them, and so on), we have 
# almost certainly identified a class of related objects.

# NOTE:
# One size does not fit all. The built-in, generic collections and functions 
# work well for a large number of simple cases. A class definition works well 
# for a large number of more complex cases. The boundary is hazy at best.
